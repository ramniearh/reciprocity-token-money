Supplementary Material files used for the high-defection and high-cooperation tests section.

Simulation information:
Six sets of simulations were run: three different population configurations, each with a benchmark and money scenario. All runs stop at 10000 steps. 
Total population: 800 or 1000 agents. At setup, every simulation has 100 money agents, 100 direct reciprocators and 100 indirect reciprocators.
	The high-defection scenario also has 100 cooperators and 400 defectors.
	The high-cooperation scenario reverts that to 400 cooperators and 100 defectors.
	The high-cooperation and high-defection scenario has 400 of each for cooperators and defectors.
10*** repetitions were run per scenario, with fine-tuned variations in liquidity and benefit. All other parameters held constant.

Data sources:
***PENDING: only 10 repetitions run, confirm inclusion in SM
